//! A method of dynamic queries with SQLx
//! Taken from this Gist by @mehcode (Github): https://gist.github.com/mehcode/c476922be0290a4f8502d18701cc8c74
//! This is sort of temporary until SQLx develops their dynamic query builder: https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/291
//! and `Quaint` switches to SQLx as a backend: https://github.com/prisma/quaint/issues/138

// CHUNK_MAX is mostly picked from my own testing.
// It might be worth making it configurable from the TOML,
// however for the general case I think it is OK to give a hard-coded value, at least for now.

// CHUNK_MAX was chosen by running archive and checking how long it took to insert storage into Postgres.
// Insertion time is somewhat dependant on this value, especially on machines with many cores available and/or
// on machines with drives allowing concurrent read/writes. Although on machines with less cores/sequential drives
// this value matters less anyway.
// Insertion times were a big hangup in previous iterations, causing tasks to time out.
// (~100-200 blocks to insert, each with 30-400 changes each,
// 400 being on the extreme end with a block that includes some more intensive extrinsics).

// This was fixed by lowering CHUNK_MAX, but allowing storage to be inserted concurrently based on how many free idle
// connections to Postgres exist. This way instead of one query taking ~10-20s to insert 30K items,
// we can have 3-4 or more which each take less time, based on how many threads exist on the system.
// Insertion times for blocks have never really been an issue, so this is mostly an optimization for storage/traces
